# Python Flask Group Project Requirements

Welcome to the Module 6 Group Flask Project!   This is your only group project
here at App Academy.  You will have 2-3 other students on your team to complete
this project.  Very often, because this is the only non solo project, this could
very well be your most complete clone site!


## Requirements


You may not clone a project you have already cloned at App Academy.  You do want
to have a diverse portfolio, so a site that is really similar to something you
already clones is also not allowed (if you cloned AirBnb already, Couchsurfing
is too similar a site to clone!)

The following requirements are necessary to pass the Group Flask Project:

1. 2 full CRUD features
2. 2 partial CRUD features (2-3 CRUD based on the feature) (yes, that is 4
features!)
3. User Authentication (this will mostly be provided in the starter, minus a
   demo user)
4. Landing Page (that is not a public resource page)
5. Presenting your project to the rest of the cohort


Your scorecard will have more details on the specifics.  You group will have a
seperate scorecard that will be connected to your personal score card (there is
a Flask tab in the scorecard for your Module 5 project, that will be linked to
the group scorecard and populated there)


## Required Design Documents


The following documentation is required for your group project.

1. Features List / MVP
2. DataBase Schema (both tables and the diagram with relationships)
3. User Stories
4. Scrum Board (either Github projects or something like Trello/Asana/Habitica)
4. Wire Frames (if you are making an original site)

All Documentation needs to be added to your project repo's wiki page. Do NOT
make or add this info to a README.md in your repo, the project starter will come
with a very important README.md that we will merge in to our group project
repos.  
If you have something ready for review, let your advisor know (in your group's
slack channel).  Do not move on to the next documentation deliverable without
getting the previous one approved (if your feature list is not approved, don't
start on the DB schema) 


### Additional Suggested Documentation


1. API Routes
2. Wire Frames (not making an original site)
3. Redux State Shape


## Daily Planning Schedule

The following schedule is when your different design documents are due
throughout Week 19.
