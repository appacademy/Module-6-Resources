# Learning Objectives For The Week

This is the introduction to Python. When you learned JavaScript, you may have
been starting out for the first time learning a language. This time, though,
you're learning a second language, which means you have some of the
understanding of concepts without necessarily knowing the syntax. As such, this
is a busy week with a lot to learn. You should be able to explain and use any
of the following in Python:

The Basics
1. Use PEP 8 as a reference for how to write your code
2. `print` messages to the console terminal
3. Use `#` and `"""` to write code comments

`None` Data Type
1. Understand the `None` data type, what it represents, and that it is the default return value from functions

Boolean Data Types
1. Predict the evaluation of expressions that use the boolean operations of `and`, `or` and `not`
2. Explain truthiness and falsiness and how Python handles non-Boolean objects in conditional statements

Numeric Data Types
1. Understand `int` and `float` data types in Python
2. Evaluate arithmetic expressions that include familiar operators and `**`, `//` and `%`
3. Predict when an arithmetic expression will throw an error
4. Know how to use assignment shorthand for arithmetic operators

String Data Type
1. Write single-line and multiline strings using the correct syntax
2. Use `len()` to obtain a count of the number of characters in a string
3. Access one or more characters in a string
4. Concatenate strings together

Formatted Strings
1. Generate formatted output using `join`
2. Generate formatted output using `format`
3. Interpolate values into a string literal using f-string syntax

Structured Data
1. Define sequence, collection, and iterable
2. Explain mutability vs. immutability

Built-in Data Structures
1. Declare a `list`, `tuple`, `range`, `dictionary` and `set` in Python
2. Explain the purpose of each data structure and the differences between them
3. Explain whether each data structure is mutable or immutable

Variables and Control Flow
1. Explain variable scoping in Python
2. Explain duck-typing and magic methods
3. Predict when errors will be thrown when using variables and expressions

Comparison and Logical Operators
1. Predict the result of expressions that utilize the operators `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, and `!=`
2. Predict the result of expressions that utilize the keywords `and`, `or`, and `not`
3. Explain how to short-circuit conditional expressions

Identity vs. Equality
1. Explain the difference between `==` and `is`
2. Identify an object with the built-in `id()` function
3. Explain when `not` will throw an exception

If Statements
1. Write an `if` statement, including use of `elif` and `else`

While Statements
1. Write a `while` loop
2. Be able to use `continue` and `break` to move to the next iteration or break out of a loop

For Loops
1. Implement a `for` loop with an iterable
2. Implement a `for` loop with the `range` data type and explain why this is beneficial
3. Implement a `for` loop with `enumerate`

Error Handling
1. Write a try statement to catch and handle exceptions in Python
2. Handle different types of exceptions
3. Use `hasattr` to prevent an error from occurring

Pass Keyword
1. Know how to use `pass` to allow for empty blocks in code

Functions
1. Define functions in Python with the keywords `def` and `lambda`
2. Explain the difference between functions defined with `def` vs. those defined with `lambda`
3. Demonstrate how to invoke a function
4. Write a function which accepts arguments and returns a value
5. Write a function which accepts a variable number of anonymous arguments with `*args` and `**kwargs`
6. Correctly order parameters and arguments in function declarations and invocations

User Input
1. Gather user input through the terminal with the built-in `input()` function

Built-in Functions
1. Use functions with iterables `filter`, `map`, `sorted`, `enumerate`, `zip`
2. Analyze iterables using `len`, `max`, `min`, `sum`, `any`, `all`
3. Work with sets using operators `|`, `&`, `-`, `^`

Classes in Python
1. Use the `class` keyword to define a class
2. Create instances from classes
3. Initialize classes with `__init__()`
4. Explain how to use the "dunder class variable" `__slots__` to reserve memory for instance variables
5. Implement `__repr__()` in a class to define the string representation of a class instance
6. Define instance methods for a class and explain the purpose of the implicit argument `self`

Inheritance in Python
1. Inherit from a parent class on a child class
2. Use `super` to access parent class methods

Properties for Classes
1. Define a "getter" method for a class' property using the `@property` decorator
2. Define a "setter" method for a class' property using the `@<<getter_method_name>>.setter`

Tree Refresher
1. Understand the basic structure of a tree, including the concepts of a `root` and `children`
2. Understand the algorithm of traversing a tree with a depth first search
3. Understand the algorithm of traversing a tree with a breadth first search

Comprehensions
1. Understand the basic syntax of a comprehension
2. Rewrite loops and `map()` calls as a list comprehension in Python
3. Choose between comprehensions, loops, and `map()` calls
4. Use conditional logic in a comprehension
5. Use comprehensions with conditional logic to replace `filter()` calls
6. Use a comprehension with different data types, including lists, dictionaries, and sets
